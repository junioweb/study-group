## Glossary of LinkedIn Algorithm & Engagement Terminology

### Core Algorithm Concepts
- **Top Updates**: Default feed sorting method that prioritizes content based on relevance and predicted engagement rather than chronological order
- **Quality Filter**: Initial algorithm phase that screens posts for spam indicators and policy violations before distribution
- **Post Testing Phase**: Secondary algorithm stage where content is shown to immediate/extended networks to measure engagement signals
- **Relevance Signals**: Factors including user interests, followed hashtags, interaction history, and connection strength that determine content visibility
- **Dwell Time**: Duration a user spends viewing/interacting with content; a key quality signal for the algorithm

### Engagement Signals
- **Golden Hour**: Critical first 60 minutes after posting when initial engagement patterns determine expanded distribution
- **Conversational Depth**: Quality metric based on comment length, thoughtfulness, and reply chains (valued over simple likes)
- **Relationship Graph**: Algorithmic mapping of connection strength based on interaction frequency and recency
- **Profile Completion Signal**: Algorithm preference for profiles with comprehensive information, professional photos, and clear headlines
- **Cross-Profile Validation**: Engagement signals from multiple trusted connections that amplify content distribution

### Content Strategy Terms
- **Native Content Premium**: Algorithm preference for content created within LinkedIn versus external links
- **Expertise Clustering**: Algorithm recognition of users as authorities in specific niches based on consistent content patterns
- **Authenticity Score**: Internal metric distinguishing human-created content from purely AI-generated posts (45% higher engagement for authentic content)
- **Content Format Parity**: Algorithm principle of not inherently favoring specific formats (text, image, video) but prioritizing engagement quality
- **Employee Advocacy Multiplier**: Reach amplification when company employees share and engage with organizational content

### Anti-Spam Signals
- **Spam Threshold**: Limit of elements like excessive hashtags, @mentions, emojis, or links that trigger content restrictions
- **Engagement Bait Penalty**: Algorithm reduction in reach for posts requesting likes, shares, comments, or artificial engagement
- **Link Dependency**: Significant reduction (up to 80%) in organic reach for posts with external links in the primary text
- **Comment Velocity Filter**: Detection mechanism identifying unnatural rapid engagement patterns from coordinated accounts
- **Content Authenticity Flag**: Algorithm identification of repetitive, templated, or mass-produced content lacking unique perspective

### Optimization Principles
- **Strategic Tagging**: Limited use of @mentions (max 5) for users likely to meaningfully engage with content
- **Hashtag Strategy**: Optimal use of 3-5 relevant hashtags mixing niche-specific and broader industry terms
- **Timing Optimization**: Posting during platform-specific peak hours based on audience behavior patterns
- **Response Protocol**: Critical practice of responding to all comments within first 2 hours to signal active conversation
- **Human-AI Balance**: Strategic use of AI for drafting while maintaining authentic personal perspective and unique insights
