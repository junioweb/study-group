# LinkedIn Content Creation PRP (Product Requirements Prompt)

## Purpose & Business Context
- **Why this matters**: LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes meaningful professional engagement over viral content. Strategic posting builds authority, expands network quality, and creates career opportunities through algorithmic recognition as a niche expert.
- **Problem to solve**: Most professionals create content without understanding LinkedIn's three-stage algorithm process (quality filtering → engagement testing → relevance ranking), resulting in 68% of posts receiving less than 2% engagement from their network.
- **Consequences of failure**: 
  - Reduced professional visibility in feeds
  - Missed business development and recruitment opportunities
  - Algorithmic deprioritization due to inconsistent quality signals
  - Diminished ROI on content creation efforts

## Stakeholder Analysis
- **Primary audience**: 
  - Mid-career professionals (30-45) building thought leadership
  - Executives establishing industry credibility
  - Job seekers optimizing profile visibility
  - Consultants and coaches developing client pipelines
- **Secondary stakeholders**:
  - Marketing teams measuring employee advocacy impact
  - Recruiters evaluating candidate professional presence
  - LinkedIn's algorithm systems seeking quality signals
- **Unspoken needs**:
  - Efficiency in content creation without sacrificing authenticity
  - Clear ROI measurement beyond vanity metrics
  - Protection of professional reputation while experimenting
  - Balance between personal branding and organizational alignment
  - Anxiety reduction around AI detection penalties

## Content & Quality Specifications
- **Essential topics** (depth prioritized by algorithm importance):
  1. Professional insights with unique perspective (high priority)
  2. Industry analysis with actionable takeaways (high priority)
  3. Career development frameworks (medium priority)
  4. Behind-the-scenes professional challenges (medium priority)
  5. Curated resources with added context (low priority)
- **Quality thresholds**:
  - Minimum 120-word value proposition before CTA/links
  - Conversational depth: Comments must average >25 words to trigger algorithm amplification
  - Dwell time optimization: Content must maintain attention for 45+ seconds
- **Prohibited elements**:
  - External links in primary post text (triggers 80% reach penalty)
  - Engagement bait phrases ("Like if you agree", "Comment YES")
  - AI-generated content without human perspective markers
  - Hashtag stuffing (>5 hashtags)
  - Generic stock imagery without contextual relevance

## Interaction Guidelines
- **Tone & style requirements**:
  - Professional authenticity: Balance expertise with approachability
  - Conversational but precise language (8th-10th grade reading level)
  - Strategic vulnerability: 1 personal struggle per 3 professional insights
- **Comment protocol**:
  - Respond to all comments within 2 hours (Golden Hour window)
  - Prioritize depth over speed: Minimum 20-word responses to substantive comments
  - Tag relevant connections when their expertise adds value to discussion
- **Algorithm-aware phrasing**:
  - ✅ "What's been your experience with [topic] in your industry?"
  - ✅ "I struggled with this until I discovered [specific insight]"
  - ❌ "Click the link below for more information"
  - ❌ "Tag someone who needs to see this"

## Delivery Format Specifications
- **Structural requirements**:
  1. Hook (first 3 lines): Problem-aware statement creating curiosity gap
  2. Value body (3-5 paragraphs): Unique perspective with concrete examples
  3. Conversation catalyst: Open-ended question requiring expertise to answer
  4. Strategic CTA: Resource sharing in first comment (not main post)
- **Format rotation policy**:
  - 40% native text posts with paragraph spacing optimization
  - 30% native video (under 90 seconds, captions embedded)
  - 20% document/carousel posts (5-7 slides maximum)
  - 10% image-based insights (custom graphics with text overlay)
- **Technical specifications**:
  - Hashtag placement: Last line only, 3-5 total (mix of niche and broad)
  - Link strategy: Pinned comment with contextual introduction
  - Post spacing: Minimum 12 hours between publications
  - Character optimization: 1,300-1,900 characters for optimal dwell time

## Validation Framework
- **Algorithm compliance checklist**:
  - [ ] Golden Hour engagement protocol activated (team notification system)
  - [ ] Native content format verified (no external link dependency)
  - [ ] Authenticity markers present (personal story/unique insight)
  - [ ] Conversational catalyst question included
  - [ ] Hashtag count and placement compliant
  - [ ] Profile completion signal optimized (100% complete profile)
- **Success metrics**:
  - Primary: Conversational depth ratio (comments >25 words ÷ total comments) ≥ 0.4
  - Secondary: Dwell time ≥ 45 seconds (measured through analytics where available)
  - Tertiary: Profile visit conversion rate ≥ 8% of engaged viewers
- **Failure protocol**:
  - Content scoring <70% on checklist triggers human editor review
  - Posts with <2% engagement rate within 24 hours trigger algorithm recalibration analysis
  - Consistent underperformance (3+ posts) initiates profile authority reassessment

## Advanced Context Integration
- **Context layering implementation**:
  1. Base layer: Algorithm mechanics understanding
  2. Middle layer: Industry-specific value frameworks
  3. Expert layer: Cross-disciplinary insights establishing unique perspective
- **RAG integration protocol**:
  - Before content creation: System verifies against latest LinkedIn algorithm documentation
  - During drafting: Cross-references engagement patterns from past high-performing content
  - Post-publication: Captures performance data to refine future context parameters
- **Human-AI balance specification**:
  - AI may draft initial structure and research integration
  - Human must inject: 
    - 1 specific professional failure/lesson learned
    - 1 current challenge being navigated
    - 1 forward-looking professional question
  - Final authenticity score must exceed 85% human input threshold

## Optimization Parameters
- **Timing matrix** (based on audience behavior analysis):
  - Executives: Tuesday-Thursday, 7:30-8:30 AM and 5:00-6:00 PM local time
  - Practitioners: Wednesday-Friday, 11:30 AM-1:30 PM local time
  - Global audiences: Rotate between 9 AM EST and 2 PM CET
- **Expertise clustering requirements**:
  - Minimum 60% content focused on primary niche expertise area
  - Secondary topics must connect to primary expertise through professional lens
  - Algorithm recognition threshold: 8+ consistent posts in niche before authority boost
- **Cross-profile validation triggers**:
  - Content shared by 3+ second-degree connections within 4 hours
  - Comments from recognized industry voices (algorithm-identified authorities)
  - Engagement from profile connections with high relationship graph scores

> **Algorithm Reality Check**: "LinkedIn specifically states it is NOT designed for virality. This system prioritizes professional relevance over emotional manipulation. Content must deliver tangible career value to recipients to achieve algorithmic amplification." (LinkedIn Internal Documentation, 2024 Algorithm Update)
